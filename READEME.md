1.2 Install Required Python Libraries
Libraries are collections of pre-written code that make it easier to develop software. We’ll install the following:

SpeechRecognition → Converts speech into text

pyttsx3 → Converts text to speech

pyaudio → Required for microphone input

vosk → Offline speech recognition (optional but recommended)

psutil → Monitors system resources

requests → Helps in web-related tasks

Run this command in Command Prompt / Terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio vosk psutil requests
If you get an error for pyaudio, try:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
